		# @return true : will return true irrespective of whether the document was created or not.
		
		# @example : in order to check the creation, call [doc.op_success] and if true, then the creation was successfull.
		
		# @logic : 
		# 1. set the op_success to false
		# 2. if the version is 0(default version for a new record), then proceed
		# 3. set the upsert to true, and set the "setonINsert" to an empty hash
		# 4. start the prepare_insert block, this method is defined in the mongoid creatable module
		# 5. call as_document - a mongoid method that returns all the attributes on the document, and then for each of its keys, provided that they are not version or op_success, set them on the previously defined setoninsert part of the update hash.
		# 6.call before persist, this adds the increment aspect to the update hash, and also defines the return_document after parameter.
		# 7.call the collection method find_one_and_update from the ruby driver, and store the result in a variable called persisted doc
		# 8. the doc may be nil if the operation failed, in that case, do nothing.
		# 9. if the persisted doc is not nil, check whether its version is more than the current version and if yes, then set op_success to true.
		# 10. finally call after persist. this basically sets all the attributes from the persisted document onto the present document instance.

		# @note:
		# the op_success is set to false on starting the method , so that in any situation of not being successfull it returns false.
		# the upsert is true, since this is a create call, and if the query conditions yield nothing, the document WILL BE CREATED BY DEFAULT.
		# the query is optional, if not provided, the query is blank, and the present document will be created, since upsert is true.
		# setOnInsert is used, since this is the only way to set the _id while creating a new record. $set does not allow to set the id.
		# document keys "version" and "op_success" are not set in setoninsert, because 
		# a) version is incremented in the $inc part of the update - specified in before update
		# b) op_success is not to be persisted, because we dont want older persistence success/failures to interfere with present ones. So that field is never persisted.
		# remember that the as_document hash is frozen, so suppose you assign it to another variable and delete some key from that variable, it also gets deleted from as_document and all variables that are connected to it, it is for this reason, that while setting the  "setoninsert" we ignore the keys if they are version or op_success instead of deleting afterwards from the hash.## had a lot of trouble with this ##
